# Simple SDL2/FFMPEG video player

Simple video player. I've focused on learning how to use ffmpeg api. This project was mostly about learning and practising real application development in C++. I wouldn't recommend using it but probalby it can be used to learn how noobie code's look. It's my first proper C++ project so you have been warned.

## Todo
 * Multithreading
 * Hardware acceleration
 * Audio and video synching
 * Some graphic interface
 * Pause, volume control
 * Better audio selection
 * Fix audio to support non stero stream
 * Write documentation
 * Fix RGB surface creation

## Building

Project was written on Windows compiled on msys2 ming64 with:
 * "gcc version 10.1.0" 
 * premake4
 * make

```bash
premake4 gmake
make -j 4
```

### Generating SDL-AV Translations

Part of code depends on translations between SDL and FFMPEG formats. They are generated by 'generate.py' script. If you need to update binding between you need to edit script and just run it:
```bash
python generate.py
```
Ps. I'm not in to python so script probably is crappy and not in proper style.

## Usage

```bash
./Player.exe <path to video>
```
